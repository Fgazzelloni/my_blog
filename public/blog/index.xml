      <description>Overview     This is one of my favourite visualizations. It looks like very simple, and straight forward with the use of the ggdist::stat_dots function to make dotted ditributions of the wages by highest educational status reached.
The Tidyverse libraries needed for the data manipulation:
library(tidyverse) The data set is the Wage dataset from the {ISLR2} package. This package contains a variety of datasets used for statistical analysis in An Introduction to Statistical Learning book.</description>

      <description>Overview     This week 10 of #TidyTuesday 2022 theme is #Erasmus students exchange in the European countries.
The data set is from Erasmus student mobility, Data.Europa.eu and Wimdu.co to discover the most popular Erasmus destinations.
The idea is to make a network of sending and receiving countries, let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the data.
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages(&amp;#34;pacman&amp;#34;) pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggbump, cowplot, wesanderson) erasmus &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-03-08/erasmus.csv&amp;#39;) The set is made of information about students, such as the age, the nationality, the lenght of stay, the gender, academic year, and others.</description>

      <title>Dog breeds</title>

      <description>Overview     This #TidyTuesday post is all about drawing with R. I have replicated the dogs&#39; prints (or paws) using R. For solving this kind of tasks you need to be very &amp;ldquo;practice&amp;rdquo; with functions outcomes. And this means to have in mind the shape the function will take. For example we know that \(y = x^2\) would shape a parabolic function.
So that, I decided to get some extra inspiration and used the ggforce::geom_ellipse() function to produce ellipses of different sizes.</description>

      <description>Overview     I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen this graphic for my blog because it turned out to be very interesting. As you can see reading through the article, the shape of the network changes along with the change of the parameters.
The dataset I&amp;rsquo;ve used for making this network comes from  #TidyTuesday 2022 week 4 Board games.
The picture below is the result of the network visualization.
The first step is to load the library needed for making the manupulations.</description>
