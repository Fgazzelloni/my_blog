## Overview

This is one of my favourite visualizations. It looks like very simple, and straight forward with the use of the ggdist::stat_dots function to make dotted ditributions of the wages by highest educational status reached.

The Tidyverse libraries needed for the data manipulation:

```r
library(tidyverse)
```


The data set is the Wage dataset from the [{ISLR2}](https://www.statlearning.com/) package.
This package contains a variety of datasets used for statistical analysis in An Introduction to Statistical Learning book.
