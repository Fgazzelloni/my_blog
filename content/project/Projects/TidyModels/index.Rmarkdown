## Predictive modeling

This post is dedicated to make a comparison between **Caret** and **TidyModels** R packages. Data modeling with R pass through data preprocessing and parameters assessments to predicting an outcome.
Both set of packages can be used to acheive same results, with the purpose of finding the best predictive performance for data specifc models.

The **Caret** package is the starting point for understanding how to manage models and produce unbiases predictions with R. As well as **TidyModels** meta package, it gives the opportunity to contruct a multivariate model syntax to manage several models to be applied on same set of data. **TidyModels** allows the use of a set of concatenated functions in partership with the **TidyVerse** grammar to build a structural model base which blends different models as one global model.


The following is an attempt to a comparison between the two predictive model structures.

## Caret package 

The most important functions for this package, grouped by steps to modeling, are:

1. Preprocessing (data cleaning/wrangling)
    
    preProcess()

2. Data splitting and resampling

    createDataPartition()
    createResample()
    createTimeSlices()
    
3. Model fit and prediction

    train()
    predict()

4. Model comparison

    confusionMatrix()

# TidyModels meta package

This ["meta package"](https://tidymodels.tidymodels.org/) is made of a set of packages for modeling, with the support of other well known packages for data manipulation and visualization such as broom, dplyr, ggplot2, purrr, infer, modeldata, and tibble; it includes:

- recipes (a preprocessor)
- rsample (for resampling)
- parsnip (model syntax)
- tune and dials (optimization of hyperparameters)
- workflows and workflowsets (combine pre-processing steps and models)
- yardstick (for evaluating models)


The most important functions for this meta package, grouped by steps to modeling, are:

1. Preprocessing (data cleaning/wrangling)
    
    recipes::recipe()
    recipes::step_<functions>()

2. Data splitting and resampling

    rsample::initial_split()
    rsample::training() and rsample::testing()
    rsample::bootstraps(), rsample::vfold_cv() and others...
    tune::control_resamples()
    
3. Model fit and prediction

    parsnip::<model_type>() %>% set_mode() %>% set_engine() 
    parsnip::extract_fit_engine() / extract_fit_parsnip()
    tune::fit_resamples()
    parsnip::fit()
    stats::predict()
    
4. Model workflow

    workflows::workflow() %>% add_model() 
    workflows::add_formula()
    workflows::add_recipe()
    parsnip::fit()
    stats::predict()
    workflows::update_formula()
    workflows::add_variables() / remove_variables()
    workflowsets::workflow_set()
    workflowsets::workflow_map()
    workflowsets/tune::extract_workflow() / extract_recipe() / extract_fit_parsnip()
    tune::last_fit()
    workflowsets/tune::collect_metrics() 
    workflowsets/tune::collect_predictions()
    
5. Model comparison

    yardstick::conf_mat() 
    yardstick::accuracy()
    yardstick::metric_set()
    yardstick::roc_curve()
    yardstick::roc_auc()
    yardstick::sensitivity()

## Caret Example with SPAM Data 

```{r loadPackage,eval=FALSE}
library(caret); library(kernlab); data(spam)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=spam$type,
                              p=0.75, list=FALSE)
training <- spam[inTrain,]
testing <- spam[-inTrain,]
# dim(training)

set.seed(32343)
modelFit <- train(type ~.,data=training, method="glm")
# modelFit

predictions <- predict(modelFit,newdata=testing)
# predictions

cm <- confusionMatrix(predictions,testing$type)
cm

plot(cm$table,main="Table")
```


## TidyModels Example with SPAM Data 

```{r tmwr, eval=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer()
set.seed(123)
split <- initial_split(spam,0.75,strata=type)
training <- training(split)
testing <- testing(split)

modelFit <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(type~.,data=spam)

# tidy(modelFit)

predictions <- predict(modelFit,new_data=testing)
# predictions

testing$pred <- predictions$.pred_class
cm <- yardstick::conf_mat(data = testing, truth = type, estimate = pred)
cm
autoplot(cm)
```
